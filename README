I searched online resources for how to write a compiler. I also discussed with my friend.

IMPORTANT:
1. Don't delete any files in src by hand, otherwise when running "build.sh", "make clean" will report file not found error.
2. Run the compiler on given file:	./run.sh <mode> <file path>
   It's users' responsibilities to provide correct directory information when running "./run.sh", otherwise an directory not exist error will be reported.
